## 1. Background
### Ronald Fisher 
![Ronald Fisher](/Images/Ronald.Fisher.jpg)  
[Ronald Fisher](http://leansixsigmadefinition.com/glossary/ronald-fisher/)  
* British Biologist and statistician (17th February 1890 - 29th July 1962)
* Widely considered to be "the single most important figure in 20th century statistics" *[2]*
* First to propose the Design of Experiments (The Design of Experiments (1935))
* Credited with initiating methods which led to Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing [Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma](http://leansixsigmadefinition.com/glossary/six-sigma/)
* Responsible for many other statistcal techniques such as [Analysis of Variance](http://leansixsigmadefinition.com/glossary/anova/), [P-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value), and [Linear discriminant analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis)

### Fisher's Iris dataset
* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a statistiacl technique used in many applications including machine learning, image recognition and genetics. It focuses on maximising the seperability between two groups among known categories in order to differentiate the two groups and hence allow decisions to be made regarding the categories. 
* A good example of the application of LDA would be deciding which patients, with a particular illness, should be treated with a specific drug and which should not. LDA is a statistical technique that can use genetics to determine this with high statistical accuracy. See the following video: [Statquest: Linear Discriminant Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azXCzI57Yfc). *[5]*
* Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper *[The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x)* *[3]* as an example of Linear discriminant analysis.

## 2. Data set Summary
* The Iris data set contains a total of 150 records - 50 records per specie, for 3 species of Iris: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. Within each record there are 5 attributes: the Sepal length, the Sepal width, the Petal length, the Petal width, and the specie.*[1]* The raw data colected can be seen [here](/Data/iris.csv).
* Two of the three species (Setosa and Versicolor) were collected in Gasp√© Peninsula, all from the same pasture, picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus.*[4]*
