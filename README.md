## 1. Background
### Ronald Fisher 
![Ronald Fisher](/Images/Ronald.Fisher.jpg)  
[Ronald Fisher](http://leansixsigmadefinition.com/glossary/ronald-fisher/)

* Widely considered to be "the single most important figure in 20th century statistics" 
* First to propose the Design of Experiments (The Design of Experiments (1935))
* Credited with initiating methods which led to Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing [Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma](http://leansixsigmadefinition.com/glossary/six-sigma/)
* Responsible for many other statistcal techniques such as [Analysis of Variance](http://leansixsigmadefinition.com/glossary/anova/), [P-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value), and [Linear discriminant analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis)


### The Iris dataset
The Iris dataset contains 3 species of Iris: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. For each specie, 50 samples were gathered and, for each sample, the length and the width of the Sepal and the Petal were measured. Thia datset provided the basis for some very interetsing data analysis.
